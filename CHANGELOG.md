# Listen Here! CHANGELOG.md

### 0.9.1
* Comprehensively update documentation and landing page for better clarity and accessibility

### 0.9.0
* Upgrade to WaveSurfer v7 ESM with vendored local copies of all external dependencies (wavesurfer, regions, hover plugins)
* Localise all external JS dependencies (Solid, JSON-LD, fast-json-patch) to avoid CDN reliance
* Merge alignment and listening into a single page — audio decoded for alignment is handed directly to the listen view without page reload or re-fetching
* Extract alignment logic into ES module (align.js) shared with listen.js
* New `/?mode=align` entry point; `/align` now redirects there
* Remove spectrogram display (performance issues with long audio; vendor files kept for future use)

### 0.8.0
* Implement in-browser score synthesis and alignment
* Fix resize behaviour for alignment and relative position indicators

### 0.7.0
* Implement in-browser alignment functionality
* Implement close-listening mode (marker navigation and interaction via keyboard commands)
* Removed "Jump to marker" checkbox and "Play from last marker" button (close-listening mode supersedes)
* UI and overlay improvements for per-waveform loading, progress, and resize

### 0.6.1 patch
* Implement ?useFiles to allow users to load audio from their local filesystem

### 0.6.0 patch
* Refactor to allow specification of Web-hosted align.json referencing (Web-hosted) audios using ?align=
* Refactor to allow ?useLocal= to allow a server run on localhost (or elsewhere) to overwrite audio URLs from the align.json, e.g., to adequately handle copyright constraints.
